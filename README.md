Retrofit init script for versioning Apple Logic projects with Git.

Tested with Logic Pro X 10.4.8+.

## Why

Apple Logic modifies audio files by embedding overview data (thumbnails) inside them. Logic recalculates these overviews if a file's modified date timestamp changes‚Äîeven if the checksums match.

![Logic project re-creating overview for audio files after Git clone](docs/creating-overview.png)

This may not seem like such a bad thing (it's rather fast) except that...**rescanning changes the checksums!!**

![Checksums changed after opening Logic project - closed without saving](docs/checksums-changed.png)

Since Git does not preserve timestamps, any clone will cause Logic to recalculate overviews, essentially changing every audio file anytime a repo is cloned. This creates a nightmare for version control and increases the size of the Git repo unnecessarily!

## Solution

1. Use [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) to store large files and keep the repo size small (LFS is based on SHA-256 checksums)
2. Use commit hooks and [Git Store Meta](https://github.com/danny0838/git-store-meta) to preserve and restore timestamps

Since Git commit hooks are scripts, they must‚Äîby design‚Äîbe re-configured each time a repository is created/cloned. Running this `init.sh` script once after the clone configures everything automatically.


## Requirements and Dependencies

* Mac OS X, tested on 10.14.6 Mojave thru 14.2.1 Sonoma
* Homebrew [link](https://brew.sh)
  * Prompts if not installed
* Git (>= 2.9)
  * Formerly higher than default version bundled with Mac OS X (Sonoma is 2.43.0)
  * Prompts to upgrade if not installed
* Git LFS
  * Prompts if not installed `brew install git-lfs`
* Git Store Meta [fork/link](https://github.com/NaanProphet/git-store-meta)
  * Custom version to accommodate DST
  * Automatically patched and bundled via CI script

## Usage

### Clone Existing Repo

To re-initialize a repo that already has the custom `.githooks` folder, simply run `sh init.sh` again. The script will prompt if any dependencies are missing (git-lfs, etc.)

### New Repo

* Create a new folder `mkdir myrepo && cd myrepo`
* Download the latest `init.sh` script from GitHub Releases
```
curl -s -L -OO \
https://github.com/NaanProphet/git-logic-init/releases/latest/download/init{.sh,.sh.sha256} \
&& shasum -a256 -c init.sh.sha256
```

* Checksum verification should pass saying `init.sh: OK`
* Run `sh init.sh`. This will do the following:
  * Setup the commit hooks
  * Create the commit-able `.githooks` folder
  * Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` at the end to setup the custom hooks folder

### Updating Existing Repo

To update an existing repo to the latest version of `git-logic-init`, simply run the following.

```
curl -s -L -OO \
https://github.com/NaanProphet/git-logic-init/releases/latest/download/init{.sh,.sh.sha256} \
&& shasum -a256 -c init.sh.sha256
```

Then run `sh init.sh`

## ‚è≠ üîÜ ‚èÆ DST Ritual: Re-init Twice a Year

The day Daylight Savings Time changes (either in the spring or the fall) you will find a lot of files "changing" because their timestamps supposedly have changed.

If you have not yet opened Logic after DST has changed, simply run `sh init.sh` manually again before opening the project.

If Logic has already recalculated overviews, that means some files themselves have changed. To undo/restore to the original:

1. First restore the files using `git restore <files>`
2. Then re-run `sh init.sh` the day after the DST change

For more info see, the [How Daylight Savings Time Affects Modified Time](#how-daylight-savings-time-affects-modified-time) section.

## Side Effects

1. Initializing Git LFS for the first time adds some `[filter "lfs"]` entries to your `~/.gitconfig` that automatically checkout LFS files when cloning any repo.

```[filter "lfs"]
  process = git-lfs filter-process
  required = true
  clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
  smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
```
This behavior can be disabled inline by turning the smudge filter off in the clone command, if desired.
```$ GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone <repo>```

2. At a local repo level, the default Git hooks directory will change from `.git/hooks` to `.githooks` so that the scripts can be committed.

Use `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` to display the current hooks directory for debugging.

## Default Rules

### Ignore

The following files/folders are automatically added to the repo's `.gitignore` to prevent too much chatter. Loosely based on https://sound.stackexchange.com/a/38454.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.DS_Store` | Excluded because even opening a folder in Finder updates it. It's a tiny file, but updating it all the time unnecessarily increases the size of the Git repo! The tradeoff however is Finder colors will not stored‚Äîuse a README instead. |
| `Freeze Files` | Files in this folder can change a lot, so assume owner of repo has access to all plugins so that Freeze Files are not needed. Otherwise, manually zip up the Freeze Files folder to upload them.
| `Undo Data.nosync` | Internal project file that keeps track of Undo History. Sometimes these files are 14 MB each, and by default Logic X will keep the last 10. Git *is* for version control so in-flight Undos are not needed.
| `Project File Backups` | Every time a project is saved, a backup is created. No need for intermediate versions, again, use Git to commit/restore actual checkpoints.
| `Autosave` | The folder where Logic records every edit until you use the Save command again. Not needed because it is assumed the person has saved before making a new commit. |
| `*.rxdoc` | iZotope RX documents. Sometimes I use RX to make changes in the Audio Files folder, and for convenience these are excluded from being picked up. |

### LFS

The following filetypes will be tracked by Git LFS after initialization:

* Audio Extensions
  * `*.wav`
  * `*.aif`
  * `*.aiff`
  * `*.mp3`
  * `*.m4a`
  * `*.alac` (Apple Lossless)
  * `*.aifc` (AIFF Compressed)
  * `*.au` (Audacity raw audio)
* Archives
  * `*.zip`
  * `*.gz`
  * `*.tgz`
* Logic Files
  * `ProjectData` (the actual project database file)

## Caveats

### LFS Storage Concerns

On most Git platforms LFS files seem to continue being stored even after commits are rewritten to dereference them.

For example, here's output force pushing a blank repo to an Azure Devops remote in attempt to "start over" again.

```
$ git push origin
Uploading LFS objects: 100% (175/175), 3.9 GB | 0 B/s, done
Counting objects: 476, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (475/475), done.
Writing objects: 100% (476/476), 48.65 MiB | 7.14 MiB/s, done.
Total 476 (delta 24), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Analyzing objects... (476/476) (6396 ms)
remote: Storing packfile... done (614 ms)
remote: Storing index... done (52 ms)
$
```

0 B/s to upload 3.9 GB!? Oh reeeealy.... This can work both for/against your workflow depending on what you're doing.

It seems currently, the only way to actually remove LFS files is by deleting the project and creating a new one. This is [documented in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/removing-files-from-git-large-file-storage#git-lfs-objects-in-your-repository) and GitLabs seems to work the same way. There's actually an [open issue from 2017 on GitLabs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/17711) to prune unreferenced LFS files more proactively.

### How Daylight Savings Time Affects Modified Time

While changing timezones does not usually change audio files, changing DST does. As a result, if a project that was worked on in June was reopened in January, then it would appear all the files would change.

![Audio files changes after DST change](docs/files-changing-after-dst.png)

Modified timestamps are set using [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), a number in milliseconds. Although the epoch time does not change when DST turns on/off, it appears Logic thinks the file has shifted +/- 1 hour. Why, black box.

In order to adjust/account for this, the original timestring format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` is customized to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZDST[01]` where
* `DST0` indicates the file was modified when DST was off
* `DST1` indicates the file was modified when DST was in effect

For details, see the test cases inside [dst-hack.t](test/dst-hack.t). These are run automatically with Travis CI.

![Perl component tests as part of CI/CD](docs/perl-tests.png)

If only Logic drove off of the actual epoch timestamp ... but alas, it appears it wasn't designed with this edge case in mind.
